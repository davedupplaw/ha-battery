# Home Assistant Lovelace Battery Entity Card

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This card is a custom lovelace entity card for Home Assistant that displays the state of a battery, including
the state of charge (SOC), discharge and charge power.

It's currently in a pretty early stage and it's my first foray into HA card creation, so it's a bit rough around the 
edges and there's plenty to do.
